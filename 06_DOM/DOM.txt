DOM- Document Object Model


ways to target the element :-

1. document.getElementById("id")
2. document.getElementByClassName("class-name")- it will give HTML collection
3. document.querySelector("")- here we can give tags,id,class-name

document.querySelector(".class-name")
document.querySelector("#id-name")
it will only give the first element

4.document.querySelectorAll("")- it will give the NodeList

NodeList is similiar to array and it has foreach method
For performing map and other functions in this we have to convert it to array

Array.from(NodeList)
Array.from(Html-collection)


innerText= it will give the visible content of the element
innerHTML= it will give both content and the tags inside the element
textContent= it will give the actual content of the element also the hidden content where display is none

if main div has many tags inside it, it is going to be called children of the main tag and main tag is going to be called parent

parent.children will give the HTML collection of the all elements/tags inside the main tag
parent.firstElementChild will give the first element inside of the main tag/element
parent.lastElementChild will give the last element inside of the main element /tag

querySelector() will return the first element corresponding to the argument passed

innerElement.parentElement will give the parent of the inner element /tag
innerElement.nextElementSibling will give the next element or neighbouring element
parent.childNodes will give the NodeList comprises of nodes

innerHTML and nextline both considered as nodes
